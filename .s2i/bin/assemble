# By doing this once during the build already, we save some time on the first start at run-time
# but on "real world" (non Minishift) envs like OpenShift Online Free Starter or appuio.ch
# this typically causes the S2I build to get OOM Killed.  Ultimately it will need the same
# RAM when running the real server after the build, but while it's easy to increase the
# Resource Limit of a Deployment, I have not yet figured out how to easily to that for
# a BuildConfig, so we keep this commented out, for now.  TODO Figure out & uncomment!
